    "      * Let's say we want to go from A to D and we want to have the lowest cost path.​ Well there are two ways to get there.​ We can go A-C-D and the total cost would be 50(30+20).​ Or we can go A-B-D and the cost is 25(10+15).​ But in order to get from A to D we have a couple of subproblems.​ We have the sub problem of how do we go from A to B, and the sub problem of how do we go from B to​ D. And what makes this an optimized substructure is if you get the optimal way of going from A to B, and the optimal way of going from B to D, it gives you the optimal way of going from A to D.​\n",
    "      * So going back and looking at the subproblems like this, you have to have an optimized substructure,​ which means if you have the optimal solution for subproblem one and subproblem two and subproblem three, that's going to give you the optimal solution to the overall problem.​‌\n",
