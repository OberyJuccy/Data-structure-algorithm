    "  * a collision happens when you put a key value pair at an address where there was already a key value​‌ pair\n",
    "  ![hash table collision](./NotesImages/HashTable_collision.png)\n",
    "  * this technique of dealing with collisions, where you just put them at the same address, is called **separate chaining.​‌独立链接**\n",
    "    * for a given key of a certain number of letters, it will always be the same number of operations​ to calculate the hash.​ ‌That means that the hash method itself is O(1).因此，对于给定的、包含特定数量字母的密钥，其运算次数始终相同。‌计算哈希值。‌这意味着哈希方法本身的复杂度为 O(1)。The worst possible scenario would be that all of these items would be put at the same address, and we would have to iterate through all of them, and it would be O(n)\n",
    "    * collisions are going to be fairly rare.​ So we treat hash tables which are implemented as dictionaries in Python as O(1). And it is O(1) to place a key value pair or to look up something by key.​‌\n",
    "    1. nested list\n",
    "  ![hash table separate chaining way 1](./NotesImages/HashTable_separatechaining1.png)\n",
    "    1. linked list\n",
    "  ![hash table separate chaining way 2](./NotesImages/HashTable_separatechaining2.png)\n",
    "  * So in another popular way of dealing with collisions, if we already have a key value pair at the address​ that this maps to, what you do is you go down until you find an empty address and you put the key value​ pair there.​ And then if you have another one, you're going to keep going until you find an empty spot like this. And then store this. This is called **linear probing.​线性探测** (And that is a form of open addressing.​  And there are a lot of ways to do this with open addressing.​‌ Linear probing is just one of them, but this makes it where you don't have more than one key value​‌ pair at any address.)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* So one of the points I want to make about a hash table is that **you should always have a prime number​‌ of addresses**. And the reason for that is a prime number increases the amount of randomness for how the key value pairs​‌ are going to be distributed through the hash table, so it reduces your collisions.​‌\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both Insert and Lookup by key in a Hash Table is O(1)\n",
    "* Since a Hash Table is O(1) for Insert and Lookup it is **not** always better than a Binary Search Tree. (Binary Search Trees are sorted which makes them better at searching for all values that fall within a range.) \n",
    "* Key lookup is 0(1) but not value.\n",
