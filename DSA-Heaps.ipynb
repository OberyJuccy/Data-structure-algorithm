    "* Each node has a number that is higher than all of its descendants, which means the highest value will​ always be at the top.​ (the value of parent is greater than its descendants)\n",
    "* A key characteristic of a heap is that it is a complete tree\n",
    "* So one of the other things that's different about a heap from a binary search tree is that you can have​‌ duplicates.​‌ (root is 99, its child also could be 99 and 66)\n",
    "* So what we have in this diagram is what is called a max heap, where you have the highest value at the​ top, but you can also have a min heap where it's the minimum value at the top.​\n",
    "* Min Heap - for any node in this tree, all of the descendants are greater than or equal to the value in that​ node.\n",
    "![example of MIN Heaps](./NotesImages/Heaps_minheap.png)\n",
    "* Now, other than having the maximum value at the top, there is no guarantee to the order in a heap.​‌ (Either way and this heap, we have the second and third biggest values on the second level. But that doesn't necessarily need to be the case either.​)‌ For Max Heap: *There's no particular order other than all of the descendants are going to be less than or equal to​ the item at the top*.\n",
    "* So **heaps are not good for searching**.​ The only thing you use a heap for is being able to keep track of the largest item at the top, and be​ able to quickly remove it.​\n",
    "* Store this heap tree\n",
    "  * We're going to store this tree in a list, and we will not be creating a node class.​ And this list, the only thing it stores is integers.​So the value of the root will go here(index 0).​ And then we just go line by line. The 72 and the 61 goes here(index 1 and index 2).​ And we go to the next level.​ And these get put in straight across this in this list.​‌\n",
    "  ![Heaps store in list](./NotesImages/Heaps_store_in_list.png)\n",
    "      1. to store the first item at the index of 0.​\n",
    "      1. to store the first item at the index of 1(this needs to be a complete tree, no gaps in the list. All of the values in the heap will be a contiguous range of.​‌) - But it's also very common to see heaps where the first index is the index of one.​‌\n",
    "      ![Heaps store index is 1](./NotesImages/Heaps_store_index1.png)\n",
    "          * **find children**\n",
    "            * If you wanted to find the children of this node starting with the left child, the equation would be​‌ two times the parent index and two times one is two.​ -> left_child = 2 * parent_index\n",
    "            * And then the right child would be two times the parent index plus one, which is three.​ -> right_child = 2 * parent_index + 1\n",
    "            * (And the reason this math works out so cleanly is because we left this index open.​‌)\n",
    "          * **find parent of a particular node**\n",
    "            * we're going to do is integer division and divide the number by two.​ \n",
    "            * So for the index of six that's going to be three.​ Now if you take seven and divide it by two that's three and a half.​ But because we're doing integer division, everything to the right of the decimal place gets dropped​ and that becomes three.​‌\n",
    "* Insert\n",
    "![heap for insert](./NotesImages/Heaps_insert_ori.png)\n",
    "  * insert 100 to the heap\n",
    "    * We will always start out by inserting the value into the next open space.​‌ And the reason for this is this tree needs to remain complete.\n",
    "    ![heap for insert-step1](./NotesImages/Heaps_insert_step1.png)\n",
    "    * Once we put that 100 there, we bubble it up to the appropriate spot.​‌ So we'll start out by comparing it to its parent.​ And since 100 is greater than 72 we're going to swap these.​ And then once we do that we'll compare it against his parent again.​ And since 100 is greater than 99 we'll do this swap.​\n",
    "      * So we're moving this up using a while loop.​‌ And there will be two conditionals that can break us out of the while loop.​\n",
    "          1. The first one is if we reach the top of the heap.​\n",
    "          1. The first step is we're going to compare this against its parent and it's greater than.​ So we'll move this up.​ And now once again we're going to compare it to its parent.​ But 75<100 So we don't want to move this up.​\n",
    "    * In the list, we add 100 in index 5. And then we're comparing 100 to its parent.​ And we find the parent by dividing five by two, which would be two and a half.​ But because we're doing integer division that becomes two.​ So we're comparing it to the value at the index of two.​ Now I'll swap these.​ But what's really happening is we're just swapping values in the list.​ And then we compare the 100 to the 99 node and the tree.​ And then swap. And because that has reached the top of the tree, we're going to stop running the while loop.​\n",

    "* remove\n",
    "  * when we remove an item from a heap there's only one item that we ever remove.​ We will only remove the item at the top.​ It doesn't matter if it's a min heap or a max heap, it's only this top item we will ever remove.\n",
    "  * 3 situations:\n",
    "    1. One of them is for when we have two or more items in the heap.​‌\n",
    "    1.​‌ we have one item in the heap\n",
    "    1. have an empty heap.​‌ \n",
    "\n",
    "* So one of the big things to remember, whether you're doing insert or remove the first step is always​ to make the tree complete.​\n",
