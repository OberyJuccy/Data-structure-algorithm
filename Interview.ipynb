And since fast and slow were never equal to each other, that means we do not have a loop. So we will return false if we have an even number of nodes. We'll move fast forward two, slow forward one, and then we do that. Check to see if they're equal.​ We run the loop again and move fast forward two and slow forward one.​ And now we're going to break out of the loop.​ And slow and fast were never equal to each other.​ So we return false because it is not true that this has a loop.​ So now let's look at a situation where we do have a loop, and something would have had to have gone​ wrong with our code to have this situation happen. So we're going to run the loop again.​ Now with this situation I'm going to show slow moving first and then fast moving second.​ It doesn't really matter the order that you do it in, because you're doing the comparison after you​ have moved both so slow and fast are not equal to each other.​‌ And we have not reached the end of the linked list.​ So we'll keep going. We'll move, slow up one and then fast up two and do the comparison again.​ And then we'll move slow to here and fast to here and do the comparison. They are not equal to each other.

So in this situation you would return true.​ If at any time forward and backward were not equal, you would return false that it is not a palindrome.​‌ Of course, you can also have a doubly linked list that has an even number of nodes.​ And then you would check if these two are equal and these two are equal.​ The big thing is figuring out how to do this for an odd number of nodes, and an even number of nodes.​‌ And of course, if you only have one node that's going to be a palindrome, you would return true.​‌"

    "* **Q34. BST - Convert Sorted List to Balanced BST**  \n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to develop a method that takes a sorted list of integers as input and constructs a height-balanced BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves creating a BST where the depth of the two subtrees of any node does not differ by more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving a height-balanced tree is crucial for optimizing the efficiency of tree operations, ensuring that the BST remains efficient for search, insertion, and deletion across all levels of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Method Overview: __sorted_list_to_bst***\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: A sorted list of integers nums, provided in ascending order. The input list represents a sequential collection of elements to be transformed into a BST. The method also receives two additional parameters, left and right, which denotes the current segment of the list being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Process:*** The method __sorted_list_to_bst employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to construct the BST. It identifies the middle element of the current list segment to serve as the subtree's root, ensuring that the resulting BST is height-balanced. The method recursively applies this logic to the left and right halves of the list, building up the BST from the bottom up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: The root node of a height-balanced BST constructed from the sorted list. This node links to all other nodes in the BST, effectively representing the entire tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Requirements:***\n",
    "\n",
    "The BST must maintain the binary search tree property: for any given node, all values in the left subtree must be less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree must be greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting BST should be height-balanced to optimize the efficiency of subsequent operations performed on the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Implementation Details:***\n",
    "\n",
    "The class BinarySearchTree encapsulates the functionality needed to construct and manage a BST, including the method sorted_list_to_bst which serves as the public interface for converting a sorted list into a BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method __sorted_list_to_bst is a recursive helper function designed for internal use within the class. It directly supports the construction process by dividing the list and building the tree to ensure it is height-balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Pseudo Code:***  \n",
    "\n",
    "Define the __sorted_list_to_bst method\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sorted list nums, left boundary left, right boundary right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if sub-list is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "If left > right, return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find middle element\n",

    "Calculate middle index mid as (left + right) // 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create node with middle element\n",

    "Create a new node current with value nums[mid].\n",

    "Recursively call __sorted_list_to_bst for left part of list (left, mid - 1) and assign to current.left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct right subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively call __sorted_list_to_bst for right part of list (mid + 1, right) and assign to current.right.\n",
